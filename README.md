Modded an electric squirtgun to trigger off of a PIR sensor

We (like most pet owners) have problems with pets on counters, so I modded an electric squirtgun to trigger off of a passive IR sensor. 

Hardware:
  Nodemcu
  PIR sensor
  Sky Rocket Fuze Cyclone Bike Water Blaster ($12 at the time)
  2222 transistor
  misc wire, resistors/etc.
